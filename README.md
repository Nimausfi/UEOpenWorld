In this game, the character should pass through challenging obstacles before reaching to reward. On the last ground, the character will be able to drive a sports car and experience accelerating, car jumping, and drifting.

By going to the SportsCar_Pawn Blueprint Class, the details of the car (steering wheel, engine, brake, mass) are adjustable to customize the car.

## Future Work

Add more features to the project, some ideas are: enter and exit car animations, UIs and HUDs, more playable/drivable cars, etc. Any contributions to this project would be greatly appreciated.
